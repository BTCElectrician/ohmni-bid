# Casebook Entry: December 29, 2025

## Summary

Initial scan of electrical workforce training funding landscape. Focus on tracking money flows from federal agencies, state programs, and tech companies into electrician training as the industry faces a critical shortage crisis.

## Sources Reviewed

- **6 sources** analyzed
- Federal agencies: DOL, DOE announcements
- Tech sector: Google data center workforce initiative
- State level: Illinois DCEO grants
- Industry: IBEW-NECA training alliance, data center shortage reports

## Key Findings

### Funding Landscape

| Source | Amount | Focus Area |
|--------|--------|------------|
| DOL Apprenticeship Grants | $100M | Registered apprenticeship expansion |
| DOE Clean Energy Workforce | $45M | Solar, EV, grid modernization |
| Google Data Center | $15M | Midwest electrician training |
| Illinois DCEO | $3.1M | Electrical/construction trades |

**Total tracked**: ~$163M+ in announced funding

### Entities Identified

- **9 entities** added to registry
- Federal: DOL, DOE
- State: Illinois DCEO
- Unions: IBEW International, Local 701, Local 134
- Associations: NECA, Electrical Training Alliance
- Tech: Google

### Leads Generated

1. **Tech Company Funding Opacity** (under_review, 65% confidence)
   - Google and others investing but recipient details unclear
   - Next: Request specifics from corporate workforce programs

2. **Outcome Disconnect** (needs_data, 58% confidence)
   - $145M+ announced vs. continued shortage crisis
   - Next: Compare pre/post funding apprenticeship completion rates

3. **Illinois DCEO Grant Transparency** (needs_data, 52% confidence)
   - Grant recipients not fully disclosed
   - Next: FOIA request for complete recipient list

## Context: The Crisis

The electrician shortage is real and documented:
- Data center expansion delayed 12-18 months due to labor shortage
- Tech hyperscalers competing for limited skilled workers
- 2008 GFC decimated apprenticeship pipeline - lost generation of tradespeople
- Infrastructure bills (CHIPS, IRA, IIJA) creating demand faster than training can supply

## Next Steps

1. Monitor DOL grant recipient announcements
2. Track tech company workforce partnership details
3. Request IL DCEO full disclosure
4. Compare IBEW membership/completion trends over time
5. Identify which training providers are receiving the most funding
