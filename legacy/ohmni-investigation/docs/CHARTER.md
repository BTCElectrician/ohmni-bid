## Mission

To provide transparent, evidence-based monitoring of electrical workforce training funding streams in the United States, with initial focus on Illinois and Chicago.

## Purpose

Identify patterns, anomalies, and signals in the allocation and use of public and private workforce training funds that warrant further review by appropriate oversight bodies.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Monitoring official government announcements and filings
- Tracking contract awards and vendor relationships
- Identifying spending patterns that deviate from norms
- Documenting relationships between funding entities, training providers, and vendors
- Collecting and organizing publicly available evidence
- Generating structured leads with evidence backing

### Out of Scope
- Making accusations of wrongdoing or illegal activity
- Conducting investigations requiring subpoena power or legal authority
- Accessing non-public information
- Drawing legal conclusions
- Taking enforcement action

## Principles

### 1. Evidence-First
Every finding must be backed by documented, publicly available evidence. No speculation.

### 2. Signal, Not Accusation
We identify patterns that **warrant review**. We do not assert guilt, intent, or wrongdoing.

### 3. Innocent Until Proven Guilty
For every signal, we document the most plausible innocent explanation alongside the concern.

### 4. Testable Hypotheses
For every signal, we propose concrete next steps that could verify or falsify the concern.

### 5. Transparency
Our methods, sources, and reasoning are documented and auditable.

### 6. Defamation Firewall
We strictly avoid language that could be construed as defamatory. No "fraud", "kickback", "corruption", "illegal" in our conclusions.

## Target Audience

### Primary
- Investigative journalists
- Government oversight agencies
- Public interest organizations

## Geographic Focus

## Methodology

See [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) for detailed technical approach.

## Governance

### Decision Authority
Ohmni Oracle LLC retains final editorial control over published findings.

### Review Process
1. Automated daily scans generate raw data
2. Data validation ensures schema compliance
3. Text linting catches prohibited language
4. Manual review of high-confidence leads before escalation
5. Publication to static site

### Issue Resolution
If an entity believes they have been inaccurately represented:
1. Submit documented correction via GitHub issue
2. Review by project maintainers
3. Correction published if warranted
4. Historical record preserved with correction note

## Limitations

### What This Project Is Not
- A law enforcement tool
- A replacement for proper regulatory oversight
- A definitive determination of wrongdoing
- Legal advice or legal analysis

### Known Blind Spots
- Non-public communications and agreements
- Internal organizational decision-making processes
- Context that may explain apparent anomalies
- Information not published online in accessible formats

## Success Criteria

### Short Term (3 months)

- At least 5 entity profiles built
- At least 2 leads identified with full documentation

### Medium Term (12 months)
